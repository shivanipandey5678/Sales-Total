📈 Enhance Sales Data Calculation

In this commit, we've introduced a new feature for calculating sales data of gaming consoles. Now, our system provides a more detailed overview of sales, including item names, sale prices, total sales, stock levels, and original prices.

🕹️ Features:

- **Dynamic Pricing:** Implemented handling for both regular and discounted prices.
- **Detailed Sales Array:** Each item now has detailed information, allowing us to better understand our sales performance.

🌐 How It Works:

1. **Items without Discounts:**
   - Original price is the sale price.
   - Total sales are calculated based on the original price and stock level.

2. **Items with Discounts:**
   - Discounted sale price is calculated.
   - Total sales for discounted items are computed using the discounted price and stock level.

📊 This update lays the groundwork for future analytics features. The commit includes documentation for easy reference.

🛠️ Technical Details:

- JavaScript code updated.
- New function: `calculateSalesTotals()`.
- Output: Detailed sales data stored in the `data` variable.

🚀 Exciting times ahead as we continue to improve our platform. Stay tuned for more updates!
